In this tutorial, you learned:

* [How to write YAML front matter so Jekyll can render Markdown pages in your site](/markdown-for-github-pages/frontmatter/).
* [How to add basic Markdown formatting](/markdown-for-github-pages/basics/).
* [How to add images to your Markdown documents](/markdown-for-github-pages/images/).
* [How to add tables with Markdown and HTML syntax](/markdown-for-github-pages/tables/).
* [How to convert your existing Word documents to Markdown files](/markdown-for-github-pages/convert-from-word/).

With these skills, you're ready to create simple but effective documents for your own GitHub Pages site.

When you're ready to move beyond the basics, there are plenty of areas to explore with the _Docs as Code_ approach:

* Add dynamic templates to your site with [Liquid syntax](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/).
* Create an automated pipeline with [vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale-action) to catch any typos or errors in your documentation before you post them.
* Group your content with Jekyll [Collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/).
