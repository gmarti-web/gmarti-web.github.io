## Mission statement

My original mission statement is:

> I will complete the PTW program for my career and personal development to grow
my technical writing skills, portfolio, and confidence to become a full-time writer.

This statement is still accurate. I continue to work through the PTW program for
my career and personal development. I want to improve my skills, portfolio, and
confidence so that I can leave the engineering field to be a writer. I've wanted
to be a writer for several years, and this program gives me an opportunity to
do so.

## Industry research

My target industry is cloud infrastructure. Currently, I practice technical
writing as part of a cloud engineering team. Cloud topics, especially cloud
data engineering topics, interest me. My goal is to write documentation for
both cloud practitioners and enthusiasts.

The primary and secondary deliverable types are:

- Developer documentation with code examples
- API documentation with endpoint descriptions

In most job listings, the hiring company prefers candidates with some
developer experience. For example, a [Technical Author](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4068265788/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=%2BfDcTSn%2BRVSFchK3CDZypg%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
post lists the following as a description of the preferred candidate:

> Is a technical writer with a programmer's mindset, or a programmer with a record
> of producing excellent documentation

The majority of positions reference a continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) strategy. They require experience with git and GitHub. [One job posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4076004596/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=FixSxzypQHOQsDbpJGMqoQ%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
describes a job responsibility as "engaging with the GitHub community" to develop
and improve their documentation. This CI/CD strategy requires the candidate to know
how to use markup languages, like Markdown, and the command line. [Another posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4077064242/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=LjmAhZUNRcS0g%2FPIvXEisw%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
lists "XML-based authoring tools" as a desired skill.

In general, these positions favor candidates that have strong writing skills and
relevant experience as a software developer. According to some LinkedIn profiles,
other people in this industry follow this pattern.
