## Mission statement

My mission statement is:

> I will complete the PTW program for my career and personal development to grow
> my technical writing skills, portfolio, and confidence to become a full-time writer.

This statement is still accurate. I continue to work through the PTW program for
my career and personal development. I want to improve my skills, portfolio, and
confidence so I can leave the engineering field to be a writer. I've wanted
to be a writer for several years, and this program gives me an opportunity to
become one.

## Industry research

My target industry is cloud software infrastructure and engineering. My goal is
to write for both cloud practitioners and enthusiasts.

### Types of documentation deliverables

The primary and secondary deliverable types for this industry are:

- Software documentation with code examples
- API documentation with endpoint descriptions

Software documentation spans
["getting-started guides to in-depth documentation on technical workflows."](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4077287219/?alternateChannel=search&refId=p1W9GyUioFPD9S88aU4f%2BA%3D%3D&trackingId=jcH%2FuCWqxBc2YcWOkLrbEQ%3D%3D)
Readers of all skill levels use this kind of document. They describe how to use
a program, how it works, or how it can solve specific problems.

API documentation is more specialized than software documentation. It defines the
inputs and outputs for specific ["RESTful" endpoints](https://restfulapi.net/).
This [Senior Technical Writer](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4051165476/?refId=54ab70a7-bbd0-4f4a-8885-ae679d0c6167&trackingId=xD7G5UnLQFedmiOK52iNnw%3D%3D)
role works on a corpus that includes API documentation. This
type of documentation helps programmers build systems on top of existing
software.

For either deliverable type, the primary audience are technical people
with experience as working or hobbyist developers.

### Essential subject matter knowledge areas

In most job listings, the hiring company prefers candidates with some
developer experience. For example, this [Technical Author](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4068265788/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=%2BfDcTSn%2BRVSFchK3CDZypg%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
listing describes the preferred candidate as someone who can work as an engineer
and as a writer:

> \[A\] technical writer with a programmer's mindset, or a programmer with a record
> of producing excellent documentation.

Because the developer experience is so important in this industry,
these technical writing positions prefer candidates who can work
in the same environment as their audience.

### Standard industry tools

The focus in this industry is on ["Docs as Code."](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/)
Nearly every job listing mentions some aspect of Docs as Code as a
required skill.

For example, the majority of listings reference a continuous integration and continuous
deployment (CI/CD) strategy. They require experience with git and GitHub.
[One job posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4076004596/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=FixSxzypQHOQsDbpJGMqoQ%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
lists a job responsibility as "engaging with the GitHub community" to develop
and improve their documentation. They require that the candidate knows
how to use markup languages, like Markdown, and the command line. [Another posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4077064242/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=LjmAhZUNRcS0g%2FPIvXEisw%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
lists "XML-based authoring tools" as a desired skill.

### Common themes of real-world practitioners

In general, these positions favor candidates that have strong writing skills and
relevant experience as a software developer. According to LinkedIn, most writers
in this industry list experience with Docs as Code tools, like Markdown,
git, and peer reviews. Many have previous experience as software developers
and engineers.
