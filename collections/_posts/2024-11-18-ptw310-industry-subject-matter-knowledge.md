## Mission statement

My mission statement is:

> I will complete the PTW program for my career and personal development to grow
> my technical writing skills, portfolio, and confidence to become a full-time writer.

This statement is still accurate. I continue to work through the PTW program for
my career and personal development. I want to improve my skills, portfolio, and
confidence so I can leave the engineering field to be a writer. I've wanted
to be a writer for several years, and this program gives me an opportunity to
become one.

## Industry research

My target industry is cloud software infrastructure and engineering. Currently,
I practice technical writing as part of a cloud engineering team. My goal is to write
documentation for both cloud practitioners and enthusiasts.

The primary and secondary deliverable types for this industry are:

- Developer documentation with code examples
- API documentation with endpoint descriptions

In most job listings, the hiring company prefers candidates with some
developer experience. For example, this [Technical Author](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4068265788/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=%2BfDcTSn%2BRVSFchK3CDZypg%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
position describes the preferred candidate as:

> [A] technical writer with a programmer's mindset, or a programmer with a record
> of producing excellent documentation.

The majority of positions reference a continuous integration and continuous deployment
(CI/CD) strategy. They require experience with git and GitHub. [One job posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4076004596/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=FixSxzypQHOQsDbpJGMqoQ%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
describes a job responsibility as "engaging with the GitHub community" to develop
and improve their documentation. This CI/CD strategy requires the candidate to know
how to use markup languages, like Markdown, and the command line. [Another posting](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4077064242/?refId=1efc6efe-c88a-4c3c-a1ad-978067e947d8&trackingId=LjmAhZUNRcS0g%2FPIvXEisw%3D%3D&trk=flagship3_job_home_savedjobs)
lists "XML-based authoring tools" as a desired skill.

In general, these positions favor candidates that have strong writing skills and
relevant experience as a software developer. According to some LinkedIn profiles,
other people in this industry follow this pattern.
