## Updates to previous assignments

I don't need to update previous assignments.

## Retrospective

The largest hurdle that I've run into in this project was finding a suitable format. I knew I wanted to make a series of blog posts to take the learner one step at a time, but I didn't account for how long it would take to get the environment presentable. It surprised me how quickly I would need the HTML skills covered by the W3schools course. Of course, applying the language helped cement it in my head much better than just doing the exercises. The formatting required a lot of tinkering with the Jekyll configuration and Markdown rendoring. It needed a lot of customization that I wasn't expecting to need.

This surprise has been both positive and negative. I'm someone who likes to tinker. So, fiddling with the settings and getting the look of the website how I want was fun. That meant, however, I had far less time to write the content. In this case, I wish I had explored that medium more in depth during the planning phase. If I knew that I would need to spend so much time tinkering, I would have built that into the plan and scheduled for it. Or, I may have chosen a completely different medium.

Fortunately, this issue is now more or less resolved. I won't need to do this same set up again. I can use what I have and continue from there for future projects. I learned, however, that the format is crucial when planning a document. The format and delivery mechanism section was the shortest section of my original documentation plan. And the time to get started clearly reflected that.
