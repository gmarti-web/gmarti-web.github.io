I finished W3Schools' HTML tutorial.

## My background in HTML

I have professional and personal experience with HTML.

As a data engineer for my previous company, I used PHP and HTML templates to display SQL query results to stakeholders. The stakeholders viewed these results on a webpage in our company's network.

I, however, didn't write these HTML templates by hand. Instead, I wrote PHP code to dynamically generate HTML code. Typically, the scripts generated an HTML table within a larger HTML document. These scripts iterated over the SQL query results to find the values that belong in each of the table's cells. Stakeholders used this generated table to review the SQL query's results.

We used GitLabs to publish these scripts. When I changed a script, I submitted a pull request to my team's GitLabs repository. After a senior engineer approved the changes, I merged them into the main branch. This process let us track changes to our scripts and their HTML output.

Outside of work, I made a website using PHP and my own HTML templates. I hosted it on Bluehost, a WorPress platform that supports custom web applications. I wrote blog posts in HTML and saved them to a MySQL server. A PHP script queried the server with parameters from a page's URL to get a specific post's contents. To add a blog post to my site, I inserted it as HTML text into a table in the MySQL server. Then, the PHP scripts automatically created a page for it.

This website taught me how to think of my content as components, rather than as individual documents. For common components, like the `<html>` tag and the `<head>` and `<footer>` blocks, I wrote them once and inserted them into other documents with PHP scripts. This let me update these components across my website from a single file. This strategy meant I could make new pages and upkeep old ones easily.

Currently, I work with Markdown both at work and at home. I still, however, use HTML in situations where Markdown isn't flexible enough for my needs. My previous experience with HTML helps me understand when and how to use it in the larger context of my work.
