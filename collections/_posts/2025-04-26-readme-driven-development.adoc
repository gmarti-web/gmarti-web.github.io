In README Driven Development (RDD), you start your project with the README file. This makes you plan out your project before you even start writing any code. By creating the README first, you have to think about how you use it, how others use it, and how anyone can contribute to it. Your project becomes more streamlined from the beginning. RDD also means your project starts with a solid foundation in terms of documentation. Rather than creating your documentation after the fact, you start with a document that evolves as the project evolves. That's much easier than trying to remember every implementation detail after you've pushed the entire project.

In this article, I discuss the pros and cons of RDD, how it compares to other "driven development" strategies, and my own experience with it.
