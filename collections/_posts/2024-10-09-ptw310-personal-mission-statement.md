excerpt: My personal mission statement as a technical writer in the PTW310 program.
---

I will complete the PTW program for my career and personal development to grow my
technical writing skills, portfolio, and confidence to become a full-time writer.

My personal statement reflects two of my career goals. One of these goals is to be a better
technical writer in my current role. The other is to gain the credibility and confidence to
leave the engineering field to be a full-time technical communicator.

In my current role, I spend much of my time writing, editing, and distributing
documentation for my teamâ€™s tools and services. These documents are not just reference
material for others on my team. Our clients are also using them. These audiences have
different uses for these documents. But they both want documentation that is clear,
prescriptive, and easy to follow. I want to learn how to improve my writing so that I can
enable all my audiences to do the work they need to do.

I am not satisfied, however, with my current professional life as an engineer. I have learned
that I am more interested in writing than engineering. That is why I want to be a full-time
technical communicator. But this switch from engineer to communicator is a significant
career shift for me. That means I cannot rely solely on my professional experience to give
examples of how I do my work. Instead, I need to build my portfolio to prove my skill to
future interviewers. I want to use the PTW program to build this portfolio.
