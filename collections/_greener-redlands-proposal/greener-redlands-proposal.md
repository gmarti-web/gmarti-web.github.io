excerpt: >-
  This purpose of this proposal is to persuade the city of Redlands, California to install solar panels on municipal buildings, such as the Redlands City Hall. This investment will benefit  the Redlands community and the surrounding ecosystem by increasing energy resiliency and decreasing the city’s carbon footprint. As members of the community and of a warming planet, we want to improve our city’s access to sustainable, clean energy. We urge Redlands leadership to take this action in the face of economic, environmental, and political instability.
