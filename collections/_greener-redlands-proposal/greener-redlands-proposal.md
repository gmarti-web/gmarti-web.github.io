This purpose of this proposal is to persuade the city of Redlands, California to install solar panels on municipal buildings, such as the Redlands City Hall. This investment will benefit  the Redlands community and the surrounding ecosystem by increasing energy resiliency and decreasing the city’s carbon footprint. As members of the community and of a warming planet, we want to improve our city’s access to sustainable, clean energy. We urge Redlands leadership to take this action in the face of economic, environmental, and political instability.

## Current state of power and resiliency in Redlands

Redlands, California residents pay [24% more than the national average for electricity](https://www.energysage.com/local-data/electricity-cost/ca/san-bernardino-county/redlands/). One reason is the area’s extremely hot climate. [The hottest month of the year in Redlands, August, averages 95°F](https://weatherspark.com/y/1965/Average-Weather-in-Redlands-California-United-States-Year-Round). Hot temperatures drive residents and city staff to spend more money on interior cooling systems.

Not only are these systems costly, but they are also environmentally devastating. Today, cooling contributes [seven per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-conditioners-fuel-climate-crisis-can-nature-help). This number is expected to [double by 2030 and triple by 2050](https://www.iea.org/energy-system/buildings/space-cooling). Growing emissions from cooling systems propel a negative feedback loop. As communities continue to depend on their traditional cooling systems, they continue to pollute; as they continue to pollute, the more they destabilize the climate.

Like other cities in Southern California, Redlands is under constant threat of powerful earthquakes from the San Andreas fault. A recent [USGS report](https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2015/3009/pdf/fs2015-3009.pdf) suggests a 93% likelihood of one or more 6.7 magnitude earthquakes in the next 30 years. Over this same time span, the report suggests a 75% likelihood of one or more seven magnitude earthquakes. When these massive earthquakes eventually happen, they can potentially disrupt power supply to entire communities. Communities that are not ready may have trouble restoring power, which [can cause major risk to property damage and safety](https://www.poweroad.com/knowledges/how-to-get-reliable-power-supply-when-power-outages-occur-in-earthquakes/).

Roughly [43% of Redlands’s energy comes from natural gas](https://wattbuy.com/en/electricity-rates/california/redlands/). The city’s solar energy production is not far behind, at 31%. However, Redlands must keep improving until greenhouse gas emitting energy sources are not the plurality. To increase the percentage of greener energy, Redlands must invest in new solutions. Our solution is for the city to lead the charge by installing solar panels on municipal buildings, such as Redlands City Hall.

## Project plan to install solar panels on Redlands City Hall

With this proposal, we ask the Redlands city leadership to set an example for the rest of the community. Redlands must demonstrate a commitment to its sustainability plans, as laid out in the [City of Redlands Strategic Plan for 2022 to 2028](https://www.cityofredlands.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/redlandsstrategicplan_final.pdf?1651172526).

The city can do so in four steps:

### Part 1: Assess City Hall's readiness for solar panels

Not all buildings will have identical solar panel installations. To assess City Hall's readiness for solar panels, the city must answer the following questions:

* Is the roof flat or angled?
* Is the roof shaded or obstructed?
* Can the solar panels extend over other areas of the property, such as parking lots or an adjacent land lot?

By addressing these questions, the city can prepare project budgets and schedules.

### Part 2: Install solar panels

With these preparations in place, the city can move forward with the installation. There are companies in Southern California that can help, including:

* [Solar Optimum](https://www.energysage.com/supplier/21398/solar-optimum/): Solar Optimum was the 2024 Installer of the Year, according to [EnergySage](https://www.energysage.com/). Established in 2008, they continue to lead the solar industry across California, Nevada, Arizona, and Florida.
* [NRG Clean Power](https://www.energysage.com/supplier/20701/nrg-clean-power/): NRG Clean Power is the leading solar installer in California and Texas. Two of their core tenets about electricity are taht it should be renewable and affordable.
* [IntegrateSun, LLC](https://www.energysage.com/supplier/26285/integratesun-llc/): IntegrateSun installs the same technology that NASA uses for their space stations.

City leadershipk must assess providers, estimated costs, and projected timelines. We suggest comparing quotes from the above providers for a full breadth of options. When you request a quote, include your findings from the initial assessment.

### Part 3: Inspect the installation for safety and quality

After the installation, an independent party must inspect the solar panels. The inspector looks for safety issues or potential shorts. They also check the physical structure to see if the panels will hold up to environmental conditions. This inspection ensures the installation is complete and safe.

### Part 4: Create community educational material

The last step informs the public of the city's progress toward their sustainability goal. City leadership must announce this achievement through the typical communication avenues. It's important for the community to know that their city is not only greener than before but can now support them in the case of a natural emergency.

## Costs and benefits of installing solar panels

Because the community funds all city projects, it's important to understand the costs. In Redlands, the [average solar panel installation costs roughly $14,000](https://wattbuy.com/en/solar/california/redlands/), after federal incentives. An additional cost is installation time. Installing solar panels can [take between two and six months](https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/solar-panel-installation-process) between finding the right solar company, drafting and approving contracts, physically installing panels, and comprehensive inspections. Furthermore, Redlands City Hall's [flat roof can increase the installation costs](https://www.energysage.com/solar/installing-solar-panels-on-different-roof-types/solar-flat-roofs-top-3-things-need-know/). These costs are significant, but so are the benefits the city will enjoy.

These benefits include:

* Solar panels in Southern California, on average, [pay for themselves in five years](https://wattbuy.com/en/solar/california/redlands/).
* In the event of an earthquake, Redlands City Hall can continue operating and aiding the community.
* Increasing green energy's percentage of overal energy generation means less greenhouse gases and a healthier environment.

By approving this proposal, you will not only improve Redlands's energy portfolio; you will also decrease Redlands's carbon footprint. As our carbon footprint becomes more critical to consider, these kinds of proposed initiatives become more important. Redlands owes it to its community to lead the way in green energy initiatives.

Thank you for considering this proposal. We are looking forward to disucssing the matter further and are awaiting your decision.
