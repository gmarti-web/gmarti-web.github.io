excerpt: >-
  This purpose of this proposal is to persuade the city of Redlands, California to install solar panels on municipal buildings, such as the Redlands City Hall. This investment will benefit  the Redlands community and the surrounding ecosystem by increasing energy resiliency and decreasing the city’s carbon footprint. As members of the community and of a warming planet, we want to improve our city’s access to sustainable, clean energy. We urge Redlands leadership to take this action in the face of economic, environmental, and political instability.

## Current state of power and resiliency in Redlands

Redlands, California residents pay [24% more than the national average for electricity](https://www.energysage.com/local-data/electricity-cost/ca/san-bernardino-county/redlands/). One reason is the area’s extremely hot climate. [The hottest month of the year in Redlands, August, averages 95°F](https://weatherspark.com/y/1965/Average-Weather-in-Redlands-California-United-States-Year-Round). Hot temperatures drive residents and city staff to spend more money on interior cooling systems.

Not only are these systems costly, but they are also environmentally devastating. Today, cooling contributes [seven per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/air-conditioners-fuel-climate-crisis-can-nature-help). This number is expected to double by 2030 and triple by 2050. Growing emissions from cooling systems propel a negative feedback loop. As communities continue to depend on their traditional cooling systems, they continue to pollute; as they continue to pollute, the more they destabilize the climate.

Like other cities in Southern California, Redlands is under constant threat of powerful earthquakes from the San Andreas fault. A recent USGS report suggests a 93% likelihood of one or more 6.7 magnitude earthquakes in the next 30 years. Over this same time span, the report suggests a 75% likelihood of one or more seven magnitude earthquakes. When these massive earthquakes eventually happen, they can potentially disrupt power supply to entire communities. Communities that are not ready may have trouble restoring power, which can cause major risk to property damage and safety.

Roughly 43% of Redlands’s energy comes from natural gas. The city’s solar energy production is not far behind, at 31%. However, Redlands must keep improving until greenhouse gas emitting energy sources are not the plurality. To increase the percentage of greener energy, Redlands must invest in new solutions. Our solution is for the city to lead the charge by installing solar panels on municipal buildings, such as Redlands City Hall.
