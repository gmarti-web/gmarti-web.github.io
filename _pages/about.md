In 2012, I enrolled in the Biological Sciences program at the University of California, Irvine. Biology had always come easy to me, which made UCI, one of the top schools in the US for biology and medicine, a good fit. I excelled in my biology courses for the first year and a hal. By then, I got restless. I knew the material but I dreaded the career propositions waiting at the end. In the middle of my second year, I transferred to the School of Engineering to get my chemical engineering degree. I graduated in 2017 with a Bachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering, a minor in Biological Sciences, and a specialization in Energy and Environment engineering.

I took a short break after I graduated. I wanted to think about what else I could with my degree that wasn't chemical engineering. I spent some time as a library page for San Bernardino County, California. Afterwards, I worked for a couple of years at JLL as a lab service technician. There, I started learning VBA. In between my real job responsibilities, I built an Excel dashboard, with lots of fancy calculations and customizations, that showed how our new Point of Use service increased the researchers' time in the lab. I was promoted to Reagent Manager and then Maintance Planner/Scheduler, with a career path aimed towards reliability engineering. During this time, I taught myself more and more software, including Python and other languages.

After JLL, I found a job at Honeywell-Intelligrated as a CMMS (Computer Maintenance/Management Service) administrator. When I wasn't working tickets, I created Tableau dashboards with data from our CMMS's online SQL warehouses. We had work order and part replacement data for several different customers, and each customer had its own data warehouse. We manually ran a report against a specific warehouse to get our data source to create or update our dashboards. Not only was this a lot of work, it relied on us to remember to refresh data before customer meetings and it reports with inconsistent names and calculations. To fix I created automated data pipelines that gathered data from each warehouse into one Azure SQL database. This let us automate and standardize our existing reports in ways that weren't previously possible. After that, my focus shifted from building dashboards to maintaining and improving this pipeline. I was working as a data engineer, even if my title didn't reflect it.

I later earned my data engineer title by joining an online education company called Age of Learning. We worked mostly in PHP and Snowflake. This was my first experience with a mature CI/CD pipeline and proper software development practices, like code reviews. The position was a great learning experience, but the pace was too slow for me. I needed something where I could experiment, learn, and innovate, like I did in my previous roles.

Milliman had opened a data engineer position for their new Cloud Platform team, and I took it. To help my manager and me better define this new role, I started writing user guides for other Milliman employees using our cloud environment. This meant I had to dive into brand new technologies, like Databricks, cloud computing, and cloud architecture. This was just the kind of work I was looking for when I left Age of Learning.

Over time, I found that I enjoyed writing more than anything else I had previously done. I worked with the Knowledge Management group to move my user guides to the company's intranet. Then I wrote more guides for brand new technologies and tools. Eventually, I started building my team's document library, including both internal and client-facing technical design papers. While data engineering offers its own satisfactions, writing has let me use my technical expertise to stretch my creative muscles in new ways. Finding the right words to explain an idea to the right audience has been the most rewarding experience of my career.

## Hobbies and interests

I like to read. I read a lot of BFF (Big Fat Fantasy) novels. I like books that discuss attention and how our attention has been affected by the digital age. I read books about books and books on reading (*The Library*, *The Art of Libromancy*, *In Praise of Good Bookstores*, *The Book*, *The Manuscript Club*, *The Library Book*, *The Devil's Library*, to name a few). The book, as an object, is fascinating and is saturated in history and meaning.

I like to cook. I like Mexican-style food, like enchiladas or tacos. I like to make salsas and sauces. I even make my own tortillas.

I like to write as well. Writing is one of the few ways I can expresss my creative urges. Even if what I write from day to day is very straightforward and fact-heavy. The push and pull of getting the balance of a sentence just right; the struggle to find the right word; the joy when someone references your work and can find the answer they were looking for. I find the craft very satisfying.
