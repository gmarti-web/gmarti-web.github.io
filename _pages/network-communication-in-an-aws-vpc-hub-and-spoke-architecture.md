## Project narrative

For this project, I created a conceptual article about a hub-and-spoke AWS VPC architecture. I wrote it for cloud professionals interested in moving from decentralized networks to a centralized network. While I wrote this article, I assumed that my audience was familiar with common AWS terminology and services. For more specialized services, I included links to AWS' documentation. My goal was to convince the reader to move their organization's infrastructure to a centralized model.

I wanted to write something I wish I had when my team was migrating isolated VPCs to a hub-and-spoke model. When I was assigned that task, I quickly learned how to set it up, but it wasn't clear how it worked. I was missing a conceptual connection to what I had created. What I needed was something to explain how network traffic moved from one node to another. This project's goal is to help other cloud administrators understand how this model works, rather than how to build it.
