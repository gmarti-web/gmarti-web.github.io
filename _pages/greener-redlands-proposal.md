## Project narrative

For my PTW320 portfolio project, I created a mock proposal to install solar panels on city buildings. I chose Redlands, California city council members as my audience. I assumed this audience's top task is to act in the best interest of their community. To help them do that, this proposal explains why solar panels decreases their constituents' carbon footprint and improves the city's energy resiliency.

I chose a long-form deliverable for this project. This let me practice a different writing format than what I usually write. Whereas [my previous portfolio project]({% link _pages/azure-web-app-with-terraform.md %}) was instructional, this deliverable needed to persuade its audience. This difference made me think about structure and information delivery in new ways. This project also needed more background research than a typical how-to guide. This persuasive writing and research exercise was very rewarding for me.

The project's short time frame meant compromises with the content. The organization would have been improved by talking to someone with more city planning experience. That subject matter expert feedback is crucial to fill the gaps in my domain knowledge. With more time, I would have expanded on the cost and benefits section as well.

Overall, this project was a refreshing change of pace. I'm happy with the exposure to a new kind of writing that it gave me.
