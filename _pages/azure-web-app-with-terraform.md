## Project narrative

For my PTW310 portfolio project, I created an instructional document
in a Docs-as-Code environment. I originally planned to create an in-depth
blog-style tutorial, like other tutorials you see on Medium or other
software source documentation. In the end, I was successful.

I created an end-to-end instructional guide for a cloud-based product. I
wrote the entire deliverable in Markdown and HTML. I used GitHub as my
deliverable's version control system. And I deployed my content to a web app
with GitHub Actions, an industry-standard continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD) tool.

Some of the most interesting decision points during this project involved how
and when to create reusable content. I wrote HTML templates for figures,
callout boxes, and sets of related links that I needed to repeat across
multiple pages. I also wrote data files with common definitions that I
referenced in multiple locations. I used this project as an opportunity to
practice thinking about my work as chunks of content rather than a single,
monolithic document.

While I'm happy with the project and the tools I used to create it, the final
product is not as in-depth as it could have been. There are topics
that I could have deconstructed further. I spent far more time configuring the
platform than I expected. The table of contents, the homepage layout, and the
callout boxes each monopolized huge chunks of time that I could have spent
writing. When I first thought of my project, I thought the platform would be
the simplest step. The inverse turned out to be true: the platform was the most
complex component.

The platform, however, is done and ready for me to use. I can use this same app
for the rest of the Professional Technical Writing program and beyond. I'm
looking forward to continuing to add to this site as I flesh out my portfolio.
