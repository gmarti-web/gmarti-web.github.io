## Project narrative

This project is a guide on writing Markdown articles for a GitHub Pages site. It teaches developers how to write common developer document structures with Markdown syntax. It also teaches them to write YAML front matter, which Jekyll requires to render pages. The intended audience can use this guide to:

* Create new developer documentation in Markdown
* Convert existing Microsoft Word documents to Markdown.

I chose this project to help developers write better documentation. I work with many developers who are either too busy or don't know how to write in Markdown. While proper Markdown may not improve content, it does create cleaner documents. This guide for basic Markdown syntax will help busy developers add headings, tables, and images to their documentation.
