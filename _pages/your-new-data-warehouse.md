## Project narrative

For this project, I wrote an article that helps data-driven organizations decide between buying or building a data warehouse. My target audience was business leaders in small-to-medium sized business just starting to invest in their data. I wanted to introduce the subject and outline some things to consider as they make that decision.

The idea for this article came to me as I started working on a warehouse in my own job. I started thinking about the investment that's required to set it up correctly. I wanted to share my thoughts in a way that might help others who might have the same questions I've had to ask myself in the process.
